Roguelike Sokoban v0.8

-----------------------------------------

*** Description ***

Roguelike Sokoban is an ASCII-based Sokoban game that has a look and feel
inspired by the roguelike genre. New maps with custom symbols can easily be
created using a regular text editor. 

*** Running Roguelike Sokoban ***

Roguelike Sokoban is written in Python and uses the curses library for its
display. Many popular Linux distributions come with Python by default, and
curses is included by default in the Python standard library for Linux. So if
you are using Linux and Python is already installed, just execute

rlsokoban.py

from the main game directory to use the default maps. To use your own map file,
use the -L option followed by the name of your map file. Use either a --help or
-h option by itself to see command-line help.

Unfortunately, Python does not come with Windows by default, nor is curses
included in the Python standard library for Windows. So, if you are a Windows
user, you will need to work through a few things to get the game running. I am
even less certain about running this on a Mac. If anyone has any success with
running Roguelike Sokoban on either Windows or Mac, please let me know.

*** Included levels ***

By default, the game will use the level file levels/default-levels.dat. Also
included however are 83 levels that have been adapted from the game XSokoban
(http://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/xsokoban.html), which has been released into
the public domain. These levels are included in the levels directory as
xsokoban<x>-<y>.dat. To play them, use the -L option. For example,

rlsokoban.py -L levels/xsokoban1-10.dat

will start the game with the ten levels in the level file xsokoban1-10.dat in the
levels directory.

*** Writing your own levels ***

It is easy to create your own maps to use with Roguelike Sokoban using a
regular text editor. You simply type out the starting condition of the level,
and the game brings the level to life. The included levels.dat file in the levels
directory is heavily documented and provides examples. More examples, including
examples that will fail to load, can be found in the src/test directory.

*** Importing levels ***

There are many Sokoban levels available on the Internet. However, they are
typically not in a format that will work with Roguelike Sokoban. This release
includes a conversion script, util/convert_xsokoban.py, which was used to convert
XSokoban levels to Roguelike Sokoban levels. You can adapt this script to import
other levels. Please see the documentation at the top of that script for more
information.
